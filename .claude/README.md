## 📋 Documentation Files

### Code Quality Rules (`code-quality-rules.md`)
Defines coding standards, linting rules, formatting guidelines, and code review criteria specific to your project.

### Engineering Practices (`engineering-practices.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Development workflow standards
- Code review processes
- Testing strategies
- Documentation requirements
- Performance guidelines

### Git Workflow Rules (`git-workflow-rules.md`)
Git branching strategy, commit message conventions, PR requirements, and merge policies.

### Quality Gates (`quality-gates.md`)
Quality thresholds and automated checks:
- Code coverage requirements
- Build and test criteria
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scan requirements

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### `settings.json`
Main Claude Code configuration including:
- MCP server definitions (Git, GitHub, Atlassian, etc.)
- Hook configurations
- Agent settings
- Project-specific overrides

### `settings.local.json`
Local environment overrides that don't get committed to version control.

## 🔧 Usage with Claude Code

These configurations are automatically detected by Claude Code when working in this project. The specialized agents can be invoked directly through Claude Code's agent system.

### Invoking Specific Agents

When working with Claude Code, you can reference specific agents:

```
@validation-engineer Please create comprehensive unit tests for the user authentication module.

@software-architect Review the current architecture and suggest improvements for scalability.

@devops-engineer Set up a CI/CD pipeline for this project with automated testing and deployment.
```

### Agent Collaboration

Agents can work together on complex tasks:

```
@software-architect @backend-engineer Design and implement a new API endpoint for user management.

@validation-engineer @e2e-engineer Create a complete testing strategy for the new checkout flow.
```

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

This configuration is automatically generated by `tazz make`. To update:

```bash
# Regenerate with latest templates
tazz make --force

# Update only specific components
tazz make --skip-mcp --skip-analysis
```

## 🤝 Customization

While these files are generated automatically, you can customize them for your project's specific needs:

1. **Agent Expertise**: Modify agent `.md` files to add project-specific knowledge
2. **Rules & Standards**: Update quality rules and engineering practices
3. **Settings**: Adjust MCP servers and hook configurations in `settings.json`
4. **Local Overrides**: Use `settings.local.json` for environment-specific settings
